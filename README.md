## Goal
Use reinforcement learning and Bayesian Optimisation in Optimal Learning and suggest methods to improve this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7966134).

## Work done so far
* Studied reinforcement learning in great depth. Read the book 'Reinforcement Learning An Introduction' by Richard S. Sutton
* Implemented various algorithms related to RL in python. Also implemented two games: taxi and frozen lake using gym library 
in python and compared performance of algorithms on them.
* Studied following paper in detail and presented report on them:
  * [Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6460-learning-to-learn-by-gradient-descent-by-gradient-descent)
  * [Learning to learn without gradient descent by gradient descent](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3305459)
  * [HJB equation based learning scheme for neural networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7966134)
  * [HJB-Equation-Based Optimal Learning Scheme for Neural Networks With Applications in Brainâ€“Computer Interface](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8437157)
* Studied Bayesian Optimisation and Gaussian Processes in depth and implemented Bayesian Optimisation in python.
* Currently writing code for new idea that I suggested.
